    "ANS- Covariance and correlation are two measures of the relationship between two variables. Although they are both used to describe the strength \n",
    "     and direction of the relationship between variables, there are some differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Definition: Covariance measures the extent to which two variables change in a similar way. \n",
    "                   Correlation, on the other hand, measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Range: The range of covariance is not bounded, and its values can range from negative infinity to positive infinity. \n",
    "              The range of correlation, however, is bounded between -1 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Standardization: Covariance is not standardized, and its value depends on the units of measurement of the variables. \n",
    "                        Correlation, on the other hand, is standardized, and its value is independent of the units of measurement.\n",

    "    4. Interpretation: Covariance is difficult to interpret because its value is affected by the scale of the variables. \n",
    "                       Correlation, on the other hand, is more easily interpreted because it is a standardized measure that ranges between -1 and 1.\n",

    "    5. Significance: Covariance does not provide any information about the significance of the relationship between variables. \n",
    "                     Correlation, however, provides information about the strength and direction of the relationship, as well as \n",
    "                     its statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, covariance and correlation are both measures of the relationship between two variables, but correlation is a more useful measure \n",
    "because it is standardized and provides more interpretable information about the strength and significance of the relationship between variables."
